### Installation

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/publish-release.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/publish-release/)

```
npm install --save publish-release
npm install -g publish-release # CLI
```

### CLI Usage

The CLI looks in 2 places for configuration: arguments passed, and a `publishRelease` object (see the [API usage](#api-usage) below for the format) in the `package.json`. If it can't find the info it needs from those places, it will run a wizard. This means that you can create a release just by running `publish-release`, and following the wizard.

```
$ publish-release --help
Usage: publish-release {options}

  --token [token]                 GitHub oAuth token.

```

### API Usage

Using it from the API will not inherit any configuration properties from other sources (i.e. the package.json), and requires you to pass all properties in yourself.

```js
var publishRelease = require('publish-release')

publishRelease({
  token: 'token',
  owner: 'remixz',
  repo: 'publish-release',
  tag: 'v1.0.0',
  name: 'publish-release v1.0.0',
  notes: 'very good!',
  draft: false,
  prerelease: false,
  reuseRelease: true,
  assets: ['/absolute/path/to/file'],
  apiUrl: 'https://myGHEserver/api/v3'
}, function (err, release) {
  // `release`: object returned from github about the newly created release
})
```

`publish-release` emits the following events on the API:

* `create-release` - Emits before the request is made to create the release.
* `created-release` - Emits after the request is made successfully.
* `reuse-release` - Emits if, instead of creating a new release, the assets will be uploaded to an existing one (if one can be found for the given tag).
* `upload-asset` - `{name}` - Emits before an asset file starts uploading. Emits the `name` of the file.
* `upload-progress` - `{name, progress}` - Emits while a file is uploading. Emits the `name` of the file, and a `progress` object from [`progress-stream`](https://github.com/freeall/progress-stream).
* `uploaded-asset` - `{name}` - Emits after an asset file is successfully uploaded. Emits the `name` of the file.
